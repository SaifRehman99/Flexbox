FLEXBOX , FLEXIBLE BOX LAYOUT MODEL!

It allows us to display our content more dynamically and flexible

Parents are called Flex-Container and Children are called Flex-Items

For Flex-Container have diff property 
For Flex-Items have diff property

so we divide it in two parts

1)Flex Container Property
display,flex-flow,justify-content,align-content,align-items.

display:flex/inline-flex
flex occupy whole space while inline flex occupy what he needs.

flex-direction:col/row;
flex-wrap:wrap/nowrap;
OR
flex-flow:row/col wrap;
first is direction and other is flew-wrap

Its all about cross and main axis,cross and main axis differ from column to row.
In row main axis from top to right and cross axis from top to bottom.
In row-reverse main starts from top to bottom and cross from top to right.

In col main axis from top to bottom and cross axis from top to right.
IN col-reverse main axis from bottom to top and cross axis to right to top.


And align-items and justify content will act according to the col and rows.

align-items/content refers/inrelation to cross axis changes.
In align items there must be some height to align vertically.
align content takes extra spaces in cross axis

justify-items/content refers/inrelation to the main axis changes
In justify items there must be some width to align vertically
justify content takes extra spaces in main axis

If we give with to the div it will divide but with using wrap it will give indivually width to every element
	

align self used to give the property to the indiviual items in the flex items
2)Flex Items Property
order,flex,align-self(inrelation to cross-axis).

In this we can flex any sigle flex-item using the flex item property.

flex:0 1 auto (flex-grow) (flex-shrink) (flex-basis)

flexgrow means how much it grows
flexgrow divides the extra spaces in the flex items

flexshrink means how much it shrink when we decrease the size of the window to make it responsive
flex-basis means how  starting size of elements reffer to main axis

order in Flexbox means to change the elements in the dom or the order.
order by default is zero(0) and the greater order will show in the right corner of the pagex
